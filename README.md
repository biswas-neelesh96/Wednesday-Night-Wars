# Wednesday-Night-Wars

---

How many of you love watching professional wrestling? Who doesn't love to watch Roman Reigns or John Cena to wrestle in WWE now? In this article cum Python notebook, I'm here to present you the [Wednesday Night Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday_Night_Wars) happening in this pro-wrestling industry. Using Pandas & Data Visualization, I'm here to discuss how Wednesday Night Wars will going to be in trend for the next 5-6 years.

This concept is inspired from the classic [Monday Night Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Wars), which was the period of battle of Nielsen Ratings between two weekly pro-wrestling shows, WCW's *Monday Nitro* & then WWF's *Monday Night Raw* lasted from 1995 to 2001; this also included the infamous attitude era.

Wednesday Night Wars is an ongoing period of battle of Nielsen Ratings between weekly shows of WWE's *NXT* and the newly-formed company All Elite Wrestling (AEW)'s *Dynamite* started from 2nd October 2019, which also marks the debut episode of Dynamite.
